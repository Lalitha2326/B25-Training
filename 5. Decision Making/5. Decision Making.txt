I. Introduction:
----------------
        - Decision Making is the process of executing different blocks of code based on certain conditions.  
        - The constructs for decision making are 'if', 'elif' (else if), and 'else' statements. 
        - These statements allow you to control the flow of execution based on the evaluation of specified conditions.
        - The basic structure of a conditional statement involves checking a condition and 
          executing a specific block of code if the condition is true.

II. 'if' 'elif' 'else':
-----------------------
     1. if Statement:
     ----------------
        - The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

        - if condition:
              Execute this block of code if condition is true


     2. elif Statement:
     ------------------
        - The elif statement allows you to check multiple conditions after the initial if statement. 
        - It is short for "else if" and is used to execute a block of code if the preceding conditions 
          are false and the current condition is true.
        - Can have multiple elif statements to check for additional conditions.



            if condition1:
                 Execute this block of code if condition1 is true
            elif condition2:
                 Execute this block of code if condition1 is false and condition2 is true



     3. else Statement:
     ------------------
        - The else statement is used to execute a block of code if none of the preceding conditions 
          in the 'if' and 'elif' statements are true. 
        - It is optional and is typically used as a fallback when no other condition is met.


            if condition1:
                 Execute this block of code if condition1 is true
            elif condition2:
                 Execute this block of code if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
            else:
                 Execute this block of code if neither condition1 nor condition2 is true

   Req: Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero

        num = int(input("Enter number : "))

        if num > 0:
            print("Number is positive.")
        elif num < 0:
            print("Number is negative.")
        else:
            print("Number is zero.")


  Req:  weekday weekend 
        if weekday goto office if weekend party, trip, movie 
        if party house party outdoor party 
        if trip outstation trip or local trip
